# 👋 Hi, I’m Keerati (Tee)

I’m a **Data Engineer** specializing in **observability**, **incident analysis**, and **AI-assisted workflows** — currently working with **PROFILE Core Banking System** on **AIX/GT.M** infrastructure at one of Thailand’s leading banks.

I’m a **Data Engineer** specializing in **observability**, **incident analysis**, and **AI-assisted workflows** — currently working with **PROFILE Core Banking System** on **AIX/GT.M** infrastructure at one of Thailand’s leading banks.

By day, I build scalable log pipelines, metrics collectors, and dashboards using tools like **Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Grafana**, and **Kibana**.

By night, I experiment with **LLM-powered systems**, **MLOps**, and build prototypes that blend AI with system telemetry, using tools like:

- 🧠 **ChromaDB / Qdrant** + **LangChain**
- 🔍 **Multilingual embeddings** (Thai, Chinese, English)
- 🛠️ Lightweight deployment with **Llama.cpp**, **Typhoon**, and **FastAPI**

## 🎯 Purpose of This Site

This website is both a **journal** and a **public portfolio**:
- ✅ To document lessons learned from the "data trench"
- ✅ To share my experiments and design ideas in AI + observability
- ✅ To showcase working demos and open-source tools
- ✅ To reflect on the *pain and joy* of working with imperfect data

## 🧪 Areas I Write About

- Incident-to-metric correlation in real-time systems  
- AIOps strategies for legacy platforms  
- Semantic search and vector embedding tricks  
- MLOps design for small data realities  
- Observability engineering in high-stakes infrastructure
